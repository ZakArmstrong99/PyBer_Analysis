# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to find and visualize the weekly PyBer fares for each city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). This was done by using the city_data.csv and ride_data.csv, which contains all the needed data to complete the analysis. The pandas library and matplotlib library provide the tools to organize the data correctly and to create a plot which displays the data. Using this information, it is possible to analyze the differences between the weekly fare costs between city types. The analysis made on the plot and data can help PyBer make changes to help business.

## Results:
The first part of the analysis was to create a summary which included information on the different city types. The data in the chart includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.
